This is my personal portfolio primarily for computer graphics projects. Nothing too fancy, just some basic HTML/CSS built with Jekyll to showcase my other work.

## TODOs
- Click on image for overlay
- Create a responsive resume with HTML/CSS
- Design a mobile version with responsive CSS
- Descriptive comments in source
- Write more in-depth articles on specific projects/topics
