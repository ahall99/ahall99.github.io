<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hi there! I'm an aspiring software engineer with a passion for computer graphics. I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science (3.80 GPA, Honors) from the University of California, Santa Barbara. Throughout most of my education, I had no well-defined academic passions, and was planning to become a generic Software Engineer&trade;. Completing the undergraduate computer graphics elective at UCSB sparked an ongoing journey of learning, experimenting, and soul-searching that eventually led me to decide to pursue computer graphics professionally. This site contains my most relevant recent projects.</p>

<p>In my free time, I love to hike, make music, and play video games. In fact, a lifelong love of video games and curiosity to make them myself is what sparked my interest in computer programming!</p>
