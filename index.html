<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hi there! I'm a software engineer with a passion for computer graphics and audio synthesis. I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science (3.80 GPA, Honors) from the University of California, Santa Barbara. This site contains my most relevant recent projects.</p>

<p>In my free time, I love to hike, make music, and play video games. In fact, a lifelong love of video games and curiosity to make them myself is what sparked my interest in computer programming!</p>

<p>This website is implemented from scratch with Jekyll. See the <a href="https://github.com/ahall99/ahall99.github.io" target="_blank">source code</a>.</p>
