<h2>Audio Projects</h2>
<p>For much of my life I have been interested in digital music production. Combining knowledge from this decade-long passion with knowledge gained from taking the Real-time Synthesis and Composition (Mus 109L) series with Dr. Curtis Roads at U.C. Santa Barbara, I have written synthesizers, audio effects, and oscilloscope music. If you don't know what oscilloscope music is, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gibcRfp4zA" target="_blank">this video</a>.</p>
<p>Check out my oscilloscope composition, implemented from scratch with Max for Live/Gen:</p>

<p>To better understand how it works, I made a <a href="https://shadertoy.com/view/sdfyzN" target="_blank">Shadertoy</a> visualizing the path and waveforms. (Unfortunately, sound shaders cannot be embedded.)</p>

<p>Music production has been a fun hobby I never dove super far into, but some of my work over the years is on my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/soaringpoint" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a>. At one point I got <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3JqFIqB1DhpmO6gczwe5RT" target="_blank">one of my songs</a> published to a small label!</p>

<p>I am currently working on interesting music visualizers, a composition entirely from code as a function of time (i.e. no wavetables, no state storage), and videos about technical and aesthetic perspectives on stereo width and even harmonics.</p>
