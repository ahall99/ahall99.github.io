<h2>Audio Projects</h2>
<p>For much of my life I have been interested in digital music production. Combining knowledge from this decade-long passion with knowledge gained from taking the Real-time Synthesis and Composition (Mus 109L) series with Dr. Curtis Roads at U.C. Santa Barbara, I have written synthesizers, audio effects, and oscilloscope music. If you don't know what oscilloscope music is, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gibcRfp4zA" target="_blank">this video</a>.</p>
<p>Check out my oscilloscope composition:</p>

<p>To understand how it works better, I made a <a href="https://shadertoy.com/view/sdfyzN" target="_blank">Shadertoy</a> visualizing the path and waveforms. (Unfortunately, sound shaders cannot be embedded.)</p>

<p>I am currently working on a composition entirely from code as a function of time (i.e. no wavetables, no state storage), as well as videos about both technical and aesthetic perspectives on stereo width and even harmonics.</p>
